Multi-user collaboration with Balsam
====================================

The PostgreSQL database underlying Balsam has strong support for
concurrency and enables multi-user workflows. You can initialize a
shared DB and authorize others to connect, view and manipulate tasks,
and launch their own jobs. This is a powerful way for collaborators to
centralize the workload in a high-throughput computing project and
distribute computation across batch jobs belonging to different users.

Balsam supports simultaneous launcher jobs and has shown near 100%
utilization across 5 concurrent jobs occupying 4010 Theta compute nodes
at the ALCF. You can provide `workflow` tags to control
which tasks run in a given job, or simply let each launcher job consume
all possible work from the database. As always, Balsam tracks the status
of all tasks and batch jobs under the project to facilitate debugging
and analysis of project utilization and throughput over time.

Just a few steps need to be taken by the owner of the Balsam database to
grant Postgres permissions and ensure file permissions are also set
correctly.

Multi-user setup
----------------

First, navigate to a directory belonging to your UNIX group (somewhere
inside `/projects/` on Theta) and initialize a Balsam DB. By
placing the Balsam DB here and setting group permissions correctly, you
ensure that other members of the project group can access your Balsam
database.

Suppose you want to create a shared Balsam DB in the current directory
named *my-balsam-project*. Group permissions should be set immediately
after creating the DB as follows:

```bash
balsam init my-balsam-project
find my-balsam-project/ -type d -exec chmod g+rwx {} \;
find my-balsam-project/ -type f -exec chmod  g+rw {}   \;
find my-balsam-project/ -executable -type f -exec chmod g+x {} \;
chmod 700 my-balsam-project/balsamdb  # otherwise, postgres will REFUSE to start !!
```

Next, activate the Balsam DB and authorize users to connect as follows:

```bash
. balsamactivate my-balsam-project
balsam server --add-user <collaborator_username>
```

!!! warning
    Only the Balsam DB owner can start or kill the server process!
    Collaborators must use `source balsamactivate` only to connect to an
    **existing** Balsam database server. This means if you intend for others
    to work with your Balsam DB, you must call `balsamactivate` first, and
    ensure that the server is left alive. Simply logging off Theta after
    sourcing `balsamactivate` will keep the server alive and is sufficient.

Activate Balsam DB and set `umask`
----------------------------------------------

Once authorized, all users can simply `source balsamactivate`, set `umask`,
and begin working. It is essential to set umask so that directories created
during your Balsam runs are writeable by other group members. If you forget
this, your collaborators will experience Permission Denied errors!

The following lines should be called both in interactive Balsam sessions
and in your launcher job scripts. **If you intend to collaborate on the
same set of workflows, be sure to add the umask line to the templates in your**
`~/.balsam/job-templates` **directory!** This will ensure
that all launcher jobs inherit the correct umask.:

    source balsamactivate my-balsam-project
    umask g=rwx

Copy or Move a Balsam DB
------------------------

The entire database directory structure can be transferred to another
location or filesystem. Balsam should continue to work normally with the
copied database, as long as file permissions are set correctly: the
`balsamdb/` directory must still have `700` permissions and
group permissions should be set correctly for everything else.
